### comments

I didn't invent the technique, I got it from my teacher in 2011 or 2012.

This is a console-like use of openFrameworks, it works on an image filename specified at the beginning of the code.

The algorithm is explained in the code file main.cpp.

The algorithm was used in one of my first coding projects in 2011-2012.

In 2019 I made a much better short uncommented version, with Qt.

Today (December 22nd 2024) ChatGPT o1 translated it successfully for openFrameworks on first try and added explanations/comments.

The Qt code from November 2019: https://gist.github.com/Bleuje/91c22639d0f312b38a07d19ee032739a
